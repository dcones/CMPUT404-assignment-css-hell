              <h3>Who I am</h3>
              <p>
                I am a driven, ambitious student beginnning a career in software development.
                My main interests are cloud computing, machine learning, cloud computing, and augmented reality.<br><br>
                On my own time, I like to play basketball, workout and cook.
                I also love the outdoors, and try to go surfing, hiking, climbing, and camping as much as possible.

              <h3>My History</h3>
              <p>
                I am about to graduate with a BSc. Honours in Computing Science from the University of Alberta.<br><br>
                During the completion of my degree, I worked as an Information Systems Intern for Capital Power Corporation,
                I did research and co-authored a paper under the supervision of Professor Denilson Barbosa, and
                I worked as a Software Development Engineer Intern for Amazon.

            <h3>What I bring to the table</h3>
              <p>
                I like to dive deep into code to get a good understanding of what I'm working with.
                This allows me to debug and refactor with ease, as I am aware of all the moving parts.
                <br><br>
                I am more than willing to do code review. Aside from the obvious benefit of allowing teammates' code to be shipped,
                it makes me a better developer because I broaden my understanding of the code and makes me consider edge cases.
